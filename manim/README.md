# Learning Manim

Learning Manim (<https://www.manim.community>).

Manim is a Python library initially created by 3b1b https://github.com/3b1b/manim. It's used for creating math videos for visualization. There are other versions of it, and are diverging due to different maintainers.

I'm mainly learning the **Community Version**, but I plan to switch to `manimgl` later which is maintained by Grant Sanderson (3b1b). The `manimgl` may lack documentation and is less stable, but it's promised to be working and also comes with a lot of examples by 3b1b in https://github.com/3b1b/videos.
