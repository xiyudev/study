# Learning Manim

Learning Manim (<https://www.manim.community>).

Manim is a Python library initially created by 3b1b https://github.com/3b1b/manim. It's used for creating math videos for visualization. There are other versions of it, and are diverging due to different maintainers.

I'm mainly learning the **Community Version**.
